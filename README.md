## Objective :

The objective of this project was to design an interactive and dynamic sales dashboard using Microsoft Excel to analyze Blinkitâ€™s multi-year transactional data. The goal was to clean and model raw datasets (Customers, Orders, and Products), build relationships using Power Pivot, and extract actionable insights on sales performance, customer behavior, and product category trends across 2023 and 2024. This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, DAX-based calculations, pivot table analysis, and dashboard creation to support data-driven decision-making.
