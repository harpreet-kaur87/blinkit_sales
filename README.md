## Objective :

The objective of this project was to design an interactive and dynamic sales dashboard using Microsoft Excel to analyze Blinkit’s multi-year transactional data. The goal was to clean and model raw datasets (Customers, Orders, and Products), build relationships using Power Pivot, and extract actionable insights on sales performance, customer behavior, and product category trends across 2023 and 2024. This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, DAX-based calculations, pivot table analysis, and dashboard creation to support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Workflow :
Here is the step-by-step approach followed to build the Blinkit Sales Dashboard:

## 1. Dataset Collection:

Downloaded the Blinkit dataset from Kaggle containing multiple tables: Customers, Orders, and Products.

## 2. Data Import:

Imported all datasets into Microsoft Excel in separate worksheets for structured handling.

## 3. Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized column names.

Formatted date fields and ensured data types were consistent across all tables.

## 4. Data Modeling (Power Pivot):

Loaded cleaned tables into the Power Pivot data model.

Created relationships between:

Customers and Orders (via Customer ID)

Orders and Products (via Product ID)

## 5. Data Analysis (Pivot Tables):

Created Pivot Tables to analyze:

Year-wise and month-wise sales

Top product categories

Customer purchase behavior

## 6. Sales trends and performance metrics

Dashboard Creation:

Designed an interactive Excel dashboard using:

Pivot Tables

Slicers for filters (Year, Product Category, etc.)

## Insights Extracted:

Total sales of **₹49,72,415**  across **2023 and 2024**

Sales grew by **13%** from **₹23.36L in 2023** to **₹26.35L in 2024**.

Identified top-performing product categories by year (e.g., **Dairy & Breakfast in 2024**).
